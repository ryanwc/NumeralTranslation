 * Buying and selling over the galaxy requires you to convert numbers 
 * and units, and you decided to write a program to help you.
 * 
 * The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows similar convention 
 * to the roman numerals and you have painstakingly collected the appropriate 
 * translation between them.
 * 
 * Input to your program consists of lines of text detailing your notes on 
 * the conversion between intergalactic units and roman numerals.
 * 
 * You are expected to handle invalid queries appropriately.
